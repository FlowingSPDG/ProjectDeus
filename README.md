# Project Deus

Project Deus is a proof-of-concept system designed to centralize the management of matches and game servers for Counter-Strike 2. 

This project aims to replace legacy projects such as eBot, get5-web, and sourcebans, with a focus on enhancing manageability, flexibility, and the realization of automated tournament operations. 

While still under development, we plan to implement a variety of features moving forward.

Stay tuned for more exciting updates as we continue to level up the game management experience!
